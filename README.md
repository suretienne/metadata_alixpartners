## Target
Prediction of the success of commercial opportunities for a company dedicated to commercialization and installation of air conditioning equipment for large surfaces.

To meet this objective, a classification model is built that learns patterns which share the opportunities that were successful and that differentiates them from those that were not successful.

The model predicts the probability of success for each business opportunity in the next 4 months, for which we do not know the actual result.
